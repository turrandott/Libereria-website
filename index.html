          <h1>Global Pizza Sharing Economy</h1>
          <p>Lock down is not for to save from the spread of the virus but for to save the planet. Why? Because so many strongly influential in the human society of this globe have agreed on a method that is not definitly the best one to control the virus itself. Is easy to get an idea of why the "bad people" agreed to stop everything. Like this they are able to take more advantage of the poorest and debiles. They can get more control, power. But to think that the entire world have been stopped only by the wish of the "bad people" is to give them more importance of what realistically they can have.</p>
          <p>Here, at this very present moment exist also the "good people" and they
            are influent and powerful too. If they also agreed in this strong
            restrictions must be a reason. Because they are involved in, it came out
            this understanding: if the influential of this human society do not
            unite their efforts for to stop, push down, fast, as much as possible,
            all the wrong habits of the crazy "machine" of consumism, the planet
            Earth is going to die. Maybe not to disintegrate, but just to became
            hospitable as like the Moon or Mars they are, places that some smart
            people want to colonize, where they even want to built their houses, but
            they haven't yet.</p>
          <p>"THE PLANET IS GOING TO DIE IF WE DONT STOP NOW" this have been said
            already, but was not taked as much important, or something concrete on
            what to act. Till now.</p>
          <p>Now we all have a great oportunity. Now we have more free time for
            understand the real situation and to redesign our lifes, restart with
            more clarity the writing of our ways of living.</p>
          <p>
            Now that the petrol is facing the lock down of consumes and his industry
            in crisis we can again take out the engines powered by water, not even
            we need the electric. We can stop and forbidden the packaging of
            drinking water in bottles and the relative transportation on wheels. Use
            that time and energy to improve the health quality and the number of the
            water springs, the aqueducts and the fountains. We can understand that
            we don't need to flush every pipi or cacca down, from the water to the
            soil, to the rivers, the seas and the oceans, because are precious
            resources that we can re use. We can understand that we don't have to
            burn plastic alias petrol or use toxic materials. Now we can understand
            that we have to stop farming of animals, cereals, other plants and the
            cut of forests. Instead we can plant food forest, protect the wild areas
            and cosider the relative inhabitants as the best treasure we have. Even
            desertic or abused areas they can be places where we help and increase
            the growth of the wild and edibles plants. Nobody will starve anymore
            and without the help of any Ong. Now we can finally understand that
            nation and borders but especially wars they have to became a
            reminiscence of the past. Without them will be possible for every single
            human to safely walk almost everywhere around the world and we will need
            airplanes maybe only to cross the biggest ocean distances. Actually an
            healthy human can slowly walk from Europe to India in about a year or in
            5 months a teenager (I know one that did it) can bike from North Korea
            to London. We don't need nuclear power production. Is not worthy the
            danger. Same about other big electricity implantation, no one of them
            can be "green". This don't means that we will not use anymore
            electricity. We can just obtain the power we need in different ways and
            especially we
            have the technology and the knowledge to use the energy more efficiently
            and directly.</p>
          <p>For to reach happiness we don't need programmed obsolescence, we don't
            need the last
            model of the car or of mobile or anything else but just we need things
            that they works well and they can be fixed. We don't need to fit our
            mentality in an economic system that needs to grow to the infinite
            because in our dimension of a globe, (or a pizza for the ones they
            prefer to see like this) fits much better a global sharing economy that
            grow when is needed but is able to decrease too and is able to
            distribute without the limit of the money. If a person that dont have
            needs food or home have not to happen that somebody else that have even
            more than what needs is not sharing. Is terrible,unhuman and we are
            humans, even if somebody pretend that we are not. As human we have to
            treat all other Earthlings as pair without falling in exaggerations. We
            can enjoy sports or games without the need of transform them in
            businesses or heavy gambling because this factors they extremise to much
            the stress on the participants rending this activities unhealthy and
            over dangerous, the opposite of what they should be. As we have a small
            taste of what means, now we can slowly dismiss the ridiculous and unfair
            habit of "having" a pet and fastly open all the prisons because they are
            horrible sistem that doesn't works. "Dangerous" people have to be
            observable in the
            society by view and care of the not dangerous one. To recluse others
            somewhere that is not visible is not the best option because the
            "dangerous" when they are also powerful they easly get out, avoid the
            jail and even use as a point in they defence (if I'm out I'm not
            dangerous) they stay out, nobody take care of them and frequently the
            more aggressives they even get commands positions. We can understand
            this and open now all the prisons.</p>
          <p>NOW WE CAN UNDERSTAND THAT IS
            POSSIBLE TO HAVE VERY GOOD QUALITY
            LIFE EVEN MORE TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED IF WE QUIT THE COMPETITIVE SISTEM
            AS
            THE MAIN AND WE SWITCH TO THE COLLABORATIVE SOCIETY.</p>
          <p>Now we have the opportunity to understand that we don't need to do jobs
            that we don't like or over the time we feel as good for us because there
            is not copetitive job for all of us and we don't need to work so much or
            to be afflicted because we have no work. We can slow down, teach openly
            and as much as possible freely to others what we feel useful and for
            that reason we love and enjoy, we know well to do and than we are happy
            to share competencies and responsibility always more. Together we can
            help each other the developing of individual and collective Knowledge,
            Empathy and Liberty.</p>
          <p>If we don't understand now and put in practice in short time the plane
            "B" of the "bad people" that is generally very into the sense of
            emergency mentality, is ready to be realized. Continuation of the
            consumist model that to be viable needs the separation of the society in
            two very definite classes: the richs that for continuing to grows their
            consumes they have to became less and less and the poors than not
            consume they will be more and more. Both of this category, with an
            obvious preference to the second one, in case of necessity will be
            controlled in numbers for to try not to kill totally the life of the
            planet by population reduction manipolation and imposed control, using
            vaccination, microchips, the sky covered by thousands of satellites, 5G
            and other electro wawes, localized pollution, drone soldiers and police,
            mechanization of most physical activities as possible, cyborgs body
            where the brain can control but is also controlled by computers and more
            always more social distances always till the end.</p>
          <p>But now we have the great oportunity. Using the correct dose of sense of
            urgency now we have the time for understand the real situation and to
            redesign our lifes, restart every moment with more clarity. Still are we
            free, we can choose.</p>
          <h4>Post Scriptum</h4>
          <p>Now we have to understand that we have to stop cultivating thinking like
            "this is mine and that is not" like "this is my child and that is not."
            All the children's are our children. How is possible that we keep well
            one or few more and we forget many others? There are many childrens
            feeling losts and alones, starving, freezing, sleeping under the trains
            of the station sniffing glue to keep going. How we think that the ones
            that we feeds and wash every day they feels about "the adult" us? How
            they can ever sincerely
            love us? They just can see impotently the situation and they grow sad
            and
            bad as well.</p>
          <p>This message is addressed to all the humans they have some level of
            power
            of understanding and also to the ones they still thinking about how to
            became more rich making the others more poor. Just reflect upon this:
            who
            is more rich? The big boss of a desolate and poor land separated from
            borders with many enemies or the many Queens and kings of a variegated
            uncountable number of wealthy unlimited and prosperous lands?
            Personally I'm not very interested on the usual standard of what is
            generally accepted as high level luxury things, I have been interested
            on
            that stuff just very sporadically during my life. Why? Because I have
            the
            experience that to be obtained and to be manteined they require
            continuous
            attentive time and effort from my life and at the end this things don't
            satisfy me very much as I feel they never enough. What I prefer is to
            dedicate to listening birds songs, observe baby puppies playing, try to
            understand what ants they speak about together, picking fruits, walking,
            swimming, get in touch with others I feel actracted by, make yoga
            exercises, trying to develop extrasensorial capacities and discovering
            new
            concepts and realities. But if some other they prefer make collection of
            big cars or glittering objects or to built and live inside big buildings
            (I
            prefer small houses, or even no house, because are more easy to be
            cleaned)
            I don't see anything wrong on it, if they like and make them happy my
            opinion is that is good. Just if they like to do this kind of things
            that
            have to find the way to do without oppress many others that are not
            interested in the same as well. They can find other people with similar
            interests and cooworking together. We all, peacefully, can do.
